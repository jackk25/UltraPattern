## Usage
* In the 3D View, press N to open the sidebar
* Click on the tab labled "UltraPattern"
* To get started, either import a pattern with *Import CGP* or create a blank pattern with *Create Blank Pattern*
* To edit a pillar's prefab, click on it, and you will see a new panel named "Pillar" appear
* Use the menu to edit the pillar's prefab
* To export, select the pattern's collection and click *Export CGP*
